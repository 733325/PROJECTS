            In the AI art generatetor <em>Dream</em> it allows you to create ai generated images without even having to
            sign in, allowing anyone who wants to try out AI generation a chance without having to commit to anything 
            or pay any subscription. Go ahead and play around with some of the prompts and see if you can't make 
            something poster worthy.
