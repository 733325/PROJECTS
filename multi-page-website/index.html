            <p>
                this webpage's purpose is to first and formost educate curious people about Ai. Whether that be through
                learning the history of Ai and where it could be going on the about page, or seeing what people can do 
                with AI right now with the AI art generatetors on showcase like the picture below.

                    As you can see this picture is very complex and detailed, a little abstract but none the less objectively 
                    pleasing from a visual aspect, This exact Ai generated artwork won a compettion full of real human artists,
                    and this stirred a disscusion on whether or not Ai artwork should be able to win awards or be sold at all. 
                    to let you be the judge, there are some links to two art generatetors and a page going into more depth about
                    Ai down below.
